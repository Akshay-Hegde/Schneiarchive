## What is this?
I really liked the style of archive seen on Bruce Schenier's 
[schneier.com](http://schenier.com), so I set out to duplicate it. I
pretty much succeeded. Though, it really only looks good if you have
a few years worth of content.

## How do I use it?
Originally, I had it in ```/system/cms/modules/blog/widgets```, and that
worked fine. Then, I had it in ```/addons/default/widgets```, and that also
worked fine.
